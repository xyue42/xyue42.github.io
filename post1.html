    <h1>Building A Racing Drone #1: Scavenging For Parts</h1>
    <p><em>September 13, 2025</em></p>
    <p>So I wanted to build a drone as a personal project of mine, and I didn't know what to start with. I'm the president of the engineering club at my college, so I was thinking that I might collaborate with the filming club to make a camera drone. But before I do that and lead my club through the process, I have to build one myself. So I decided on a simple racing drone, maximizing efficiency and keeping it basic. Little did I know, this would turn out to be a very expensive endeavor. </p>
